# TimescaleDB
* It's an extension for postgres that improves querying for time series data
* You create something called hypertable over a PostgreSQL table that will assist with data partitioning and bucketing based on time
* BTW, you can still normally query the table using PostgreSQL

# TODO
* Should be fun exploring how it partitions data and queries.
* Algorithms used under the hood
* What kind of indexes it builds and maintains
