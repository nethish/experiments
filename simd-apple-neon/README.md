# SIMD 
* In a single cpu instruction, the processor can process multiple input data to produce multiple output/ single output
* This is leveraged by using 128 bit registers in Mac/ Intel. We can store 4 32 bit integers in the register to perform an operation
* What I observed is SIMD wasn't that much faster
