# Format Preserving Encryption
* Preserve the format as it is before encrytion 
* For example Credit Card Number - Keep the cipher 16 digit number
* DOB Encryption - Preserve the schema

## Some examples from ChatGPT
* Credit card encryption (PCI DSS compliance)
* Social security numbers (SSNs)
* Account numbers
* Date-of-birth fields
* Anywhere systems expect fixed formats and can't easily change schemas.
