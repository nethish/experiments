# K8s CRD
Follow https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/

Kubernetes resources are just objects. Now, you attach hooks on those objects and perform actions.
This is a controller now.
Package the controller with some logic, and it becomes an operator.

# Status
Some failed attempts, but I understand on a very high level what this can do
Will revisit later.
