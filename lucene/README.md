# Lucene
* From what I see it's just a library that parses text, tokenizes it and stores data to disk.
* Elastic Search is built on top of Lucene which adds distributed compute, aggregations and backup features

# TODO
* Create a standalone Java file that uses lucene to store and retrieve data
* There is Lucene Luke to analyze the stored indexes in lucene
* These Java apps are not easy to just write and test :sad:
